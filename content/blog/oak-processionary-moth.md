Oak trees are a cherished feature in many gardens, offering shade and enhancing the landscape's beauty. However, they can sometimes become hosts to the Oak Processionary Moth (OPM), a pest that poses risks to both tree health and human well-being. This guide is designed for everyday gardeners, helping you identify OPM and understand how to respond safely and effectively.

## **What Is the Oak Processionary Moth?**

The **Oak Processionary Moth (_Thaumetopoea processionea_)** is an invasive species native to southern Europe but has spread to other regions, including parts of the UK. The moth's caterpillars are of particular concern due to their distinctive behavior and the health hazards they present.

### **Key Characteristics:**

- **Processions:** Caterpillars move in nose-to-tail lines, resembling a procession.
- **Irritating Hairs:** Their bodies are covered with tiny, toxic hairs that can cause health issues.
- **Seasonal Appearance:** Caterpillars are most active from late spring to early summer.

## **Why Is OPM a Problem?**

### **Health Risks:**

- **Skin Irritation:** Contact can lead to rashes, itching, and dermatitis.
- **Respiratory Issues:** Inhaling the tiny hairs may cause sore throats, breathing difficulties, or allergic reactions.
- **Eye Irritation:** Hairs can cause conjunctivitis and other eye problems.
- **Pets at Risk:** Animals can also suffer similar symptoms if exposed.

### **Tree Health Concerns:**

- **Defoliation:** Caterpillars feed on oak leaves, weakening the tree by reducing its ability to photosynthesize.
- **Increased Vulnerability:** Weakened trees become more susceptible to other pests and diseases.
