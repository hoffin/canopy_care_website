## The Best Time for Planting

While trees can be planted almost year-round with proper care, certain times are optimal:

- **Autumn (October-November)**: Ideal for most deciduous trees, allowing root establishment before summer
- **Winter (December-February)**: Good for dormant bare-root trees when ground isn't frozen
- **Early Spring (March-April)**: Excellent for many species before the stress of summer heat
- **Container-Grown Trees**: Can be planted almost any time with proper care, but avoid extremely hot periods

Our experts will advise on the optimal planting time for your specific trees and situation.
