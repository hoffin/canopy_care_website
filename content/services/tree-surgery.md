# Professional Tree Surgery Services

Tree surgery is essential for maintaining the health, safety, and aesthetic appeal of your trees. At Canopy Care, our qualified arborists provide expert tree surgery services to ensure your trees remain in optimal condition.

## Our Tree Surgery Services Include:

### Crown Reduction
Crown reduction involves reducing the overall size of a tree's canopy while maintaining its natural shape. This technique is used when:
- A tree has grown too large for its location
- Branches are interfering with property or utility lines
- Reducing wind resistance is necessary to prevent storm damage

Our arborists carefully select branches for removal to ensure the tree's health is preserved while achieving the desired reduction in size.

### Crown Thinning
Crown thinning reduces the density of a tree's foliage without altering its size or shape. Benefits include:
- Increased light penetration through the canopy
- Reduced wind resistance
- Improved air circulation to reduce disease risk
- Enhanced visibility of the tree's branch structure

### Deadwood Removal
Removing dead, dying, or diseased branches is crucial for:
- Preventing the spread of disease to healthy parts of the tree
- Reducing the risk of falling branches
- Improving the tree's appearance
- Promoting healthy new growth

### Crown Lifting
Crown lifting involves removing lower branches to increase clearance between the ground and the canopy. This is particularly useful for:
- Improving access beneath trees
- Increasing light to areas beneath the tree
- Clearing visibility for traffic or pedestrians
- Preventing branches from touching buildings or structures

### Pollarding and Formative Pruning
For young or specific ornamental trees, we offer specialized pruning techniques to:
- Guide proper growth patterns
- Establish strong branch structures
- Manage tree size in restricted spaces
- Rejuvenate older trees
